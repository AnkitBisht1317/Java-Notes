# POLYMORPHISM 
- One name but multiple form is concept of polymorphism.
1. Method name is same but apply different type of argument.
2. Method signature is same but in parent one type of implementation but child class another type of implementation.

# Coupling 
- The degree of dependence with in the component it called coupling
- if dependence is more then is consider as it called tightly coupling when dependence is less then it called loosely coupling.

# COHESION
- For every component a clear well define functionallity is requried then the component said to be high cohension.
- High cohension is always good programming oratices because it has varoius advantages.
   - Without effect reaming component we can modifie any component
   - It promote reuseability of code.
   - it improve maintainability of code.
